## What Did I Learn While Developing This Application?

While developing this to-do list application, I learnt some basic skills of back-end management of a mobile application, especially on mantaining data persistence in my app.

Since I have experienced with designing an UI of a mobile application in <b>Pekan RISTEK Open Class back in 2023</b>, I still can get the designing part without facing a massive trouble. But it still an interesting challange to explore some new ways of designing UI with Flutter and Dart.
